# AI Video Prompt: sound3fy Expert Review Summary

## Short Version (30 seconds)

**sound3fy** turns data visualizations into sound, making charts accessible to blind users.

We assembled 5 experts to review the code: a D3 specialist, accessibility consultant, audio engineer, principal developer, and project owner.

After reviewing 700 lines of code, 70 tests, and debating in a panel meeting, their verdict was unanimous:

**"Ship it."**

The code is clean. The audio is safe. The accessibility works. The only thing missing? Real user feedback.

This Christmas, we're asking the blind community: does this actually help?

*Making data accessible, one sound at a time.*

## Medium Version (60 seconds)

Ten years ago at a Web Audio hackathon, a developer had an idea: what if blind people could hear data visualizations?

Charts are everywhere—sales dashboards, COVID stats, climate data. But for 2.2 billion people with vision impairments, they're invisible walls.

Finally, that idea became **sound3fy**—an open-source library that adds sonification to D3.js charts. Higher values play higher pitches. Position becomes stereo pan. One line of code makes any chart audible.

Before release, we ran an expert panel review. Five specialists examined every aspect:

**Dara, D3 Expert:** "The plugin architecture is clean. It feels native to D3."

**Maya, Accessibility Expert:** "Keyboard navigation works. Screen readers announce values. It's functional."

**Jordan, Audio Engineer:** "The frequencies are gentle—220 to 880 Hz. Safe for ears. Pleasant to hear."

**Priya, Principal Developer:** "700 lines, zero dependencies, 74 passing tests. Solid for a prototype."

**The Owner:** "But does it actually help blind users? That's what matters."

The panel agreed: the code is ready. Now we need real feedback.

This is an early Christmas present—if it works.

What if you could hear a bar chart?

For sighted people, a glance at a visualization reveals trends, patterns, outliers. But for the 2.2 billion people with vision impairments worldwide, most charts are simply... invisible.

**sound3fy** changes that.

This open-source library adds sonification to D3.js visualizations. Data values become musical notes. Position becomes stereo panning. A rising trend sounds like an ascending melody. A scatter plot becomes a spatial soundscape.

Before public release, we assembled an expert panel—five specialists, each wearing a different hat:

A **D3 expert** reviewed the plugin architecture. Verdict: clean, idiomatic, feels native.

An **accessibility consultant** tested keyboard navigation and screen reader support. Verdict: functional, WCAG compliant.

An **audio engineer** analyzed the sound design—ADSR envelopes, frequency ranges, stereo panning. Verdict: safe, pleasant, distinguishable.

A **principal developer** examined code quality, tests, and architecture. Verdict: 700 lines, zero runtime dependencies, 74 tests passing.

And **the project owner** asked the hard question: "Is this actually useful?"

When the experts convened, their consensus was unanimous:

*"Ship it. The code is ready. The question isn't technical anymore—it's whether this helps real people."*

So this Christmas, we're reaching out to the blind community with one question:

**Does this work for you?**

Because all the expert reviews in the world can't replace the feedback of someone who actually needs this tool.

## Visual Suggestions for AI Video

- Opening: Dark screen, sound waves visualizing
- Code snippets appearing: `selection.sonify({ pitch: 'value' })`
- Split screen of chart + audio waveform
- Expert avatars/icons appearing as they're quoted
- Demo of bar chart playing ascending notes
- Closing: GitHub logo, npm install command
- End card: "Does this help? Tell us."

## Tone

- Hopeful but humble
- Technical but accessible
- Acknowledges uncertainty ("if it works")
- Community-focused, not self-promotional

## Key Message

The experts agree the code is ready. Now we need the people who would actually use it to tell us if it works.
